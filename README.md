## Why Use SunrinLife?

### Integration

Many schools have discrete services created by multiple people.
While this might sound not so bad, multiple individual services scattered around the web causes services to be less accessible.
This is where SunrinLife comes in. SunrinLife integrates various services into one convenient location, making using services more accessible, easier, and faster.


### Extensible, unbeatable scalability

Customize your service with ease!
With SunrinLife, you can create various extensions easier than ever before.
SunrinLife's modularized design fully takes advantage of scalability, stability, and customizability.
